# AutoResume-Standardizer

The GenAI Resume Standardizer is a generative AIâ€“powered application designed to automatically extract, structure, and standardize resume data from unstructured documents (PDF/DOCX). Using advanced language models, the system parses resumes to identify key details such as personal information, skills, education, experiences, certifications, and languages.

Once extracted, the information is transformed into a consistent structured format and exported into a clean, standardized resume document (DOCX). This ensures uniformity across resumes, making it easier for recruiters, hiring managers, and automated HR systems to review candidate profiles efficiently.

## Key Features

ðŸ“„ Multi-format Input â€“ Supports both PDF and DOCX resumes.

ðŸ¤– Generative AI Parsing â€“ Extracts structured data using schema-driven JSON outputs.

ðŸŽ¯ Standardized Output â€“ Generates professional, consistent resume formats automatically.

## Potential Extensions

2. Support for multilingual resumes.

3. Scoring/ranking candidates based on extracted features.
